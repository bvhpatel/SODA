To generate and include manifest files automatically, simply toggle the option to "Yes". Then, when you generate the dataset (Step 6), a "manifest.xlsx" file will be added to each high-level SPARC folder with the "filename", "timestamp", and "file type" fields automatically populated in the correct format while the "description" and "Additional Metadata" fields will be filled when specified during Step 3. Note that any existing manifest files at the target location for generating the dataset will be replaced.
