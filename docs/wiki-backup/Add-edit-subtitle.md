## Background

All SPARC datasets must have the following metadata on Blackfynn: subtitle, description, banner image, and license. This interface allows you to easily add a subtitle to your dataset. This subtitle will become the short description visible immediately under the title of your dataset once it is published.

## How to 

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and dataset. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. In the textbox, add two or three sentences (limit of 256 characters) that describe the content of your dataset such that it is possible to differentiate it from other datasets. 
3. Click on "Add subtitle".
