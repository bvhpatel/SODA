# Download and Open the Application
To use SODA, **first download and install the** [**Blackfynn agent**](https://developer.blackfynn.io/agent/index.html). Then, follow the instructions below for your specific platform:

### **Windows** (developed and tested on Windows 10)
1. Download the [Windows installer](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/releases/download/v4.0.0-beta/SODA-4.0.0-beta.exe).
2. Double click on the installer (.exe file), it will start the installation process (if there is a permission issue try 
 right click and select "Run as administrator").
3. Follow the installation instructions.
4. Once the application is installed, you can run the application by either running the desktop shortcut, searching for "SODA" on the start menu, or from the installation folder.
5. To stop the application, simply click on the cross in the top right corner.

The downloaded installer file could be deleted since it is not necessary to run SODA. The SODA app can be uninstalled from the Program manager (under Control Panel) as any other app on Windows.

### **macOS** (developed and tested on macOS Catalina 10.15)

2. Double-click on the installer (.dmg file) and, in the installation window, drag the SODA icon into the "Applications" folder. Security preferences may need to be changed (System Preferences>Security & Privacy>General Tab>"Open anyway").
3. To stop the application, click on the red circle/button in the top left corner.

The downloaded installer could be deleted since it is not necessary to run SODA. To uninstall the SODA app, simply delete it from your computerâ€™s "Applications" folder.

### **Ubuntu** (developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS)
1. Download [Linux Appimage](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/releases/download/v4.0.0-beta/SODA-4.0.0-beta.AppImage).
2. Right click on the downloaded file and go to the permissions tab.
3. Click the 'Allow executing file as program' and make sure it has a checkmark.
3. Double click the downloaded SODA app icon and it should open the app.

Since our Linux SODA app is in the AppImage format, you can move this file to anywhere on your computer and run it. If you would like to move the app into the applications folder, we recommend you use the open source [AppImage Launcher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to organize and handle all AppImage programs for your Linux system.

### Notes

SODA may work on OS versions other than those mentioned above but it hasn't been tested.
