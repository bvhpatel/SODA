## Background

All SPARC datasets must have the following metadata on Blackfynn: subtitle, description, banner image, and license. This interface allows you to easily add a banner image to your dataset. This image will be associated with the dataset and used as a thumbnail once the dataset is published.

## How to 

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and dataset. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. Click on "Edit banner image" 
3. Click on "Import image" in the new pop-up window.
4. Select the image file you want to use as a banner image.
5. Crop the file as desired. Note that all banner images must be square, have a minimum display size of 512x512 px (1024x1024 px preferred), and have a maximum file size of 5 MB.
6. Click on "Save changes".
