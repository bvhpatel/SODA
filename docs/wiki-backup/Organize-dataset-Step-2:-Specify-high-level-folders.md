Select the high-level folder(s) to be included in your dataset. Refer to the description provided in the figure [here](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Organize-dataset#background) about the content of each folder to determine which folder you need for your dataset. A high-level folder can only be included from Step 2 and removed from Step 3. You can always come back to this step to include more folders. If you started with an existing dataset (local or Blackfynn), any high-level folder included in that dataset will be automatically selected.
