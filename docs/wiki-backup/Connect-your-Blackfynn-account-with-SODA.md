## Background

SPARC uses the [Blackfynn](https://www.blackfynn.com/) platform to store data and metadata files as well as append additional metadata. All SPARC researchers must thus share their data on Blackfynn. When using SODA for the first time, you will have to connect your Blackfynn account with SODA to use Blackfynn related functionalities implemented in SODA.

## How to

1. Click on any features (e.g. Create a new dataset) under Manage Datasets.
2. Click on the edit symbol next to "Current account".
3. In the new pop up window click on "Add new account".
4. Follow the instructions on the [Blackfynn help page](https://help.blackfynn.com/en/articles/1488536-creating-an-api-key-for-the-blackfynn-clients) to get a key name, API key, and API secret from your Blackfynn account. Make sure you are under the "SPARC Consortium" organization on Blackfynn when you generate the API key and secret.

## Note

* During subsequent uses, SODA will automatically connect to the Blackfynn account you were connected to the last time. 

* The account key and secret for your Blackfynn account(s) will be stored on your computer only, so neither the SODA Team nor anyone else besides you will have access to your Blackfynn account(s).
