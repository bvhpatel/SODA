## Background

SODA make use of the <a href="https://airtable.com/tblFGEvUoTbbG6tJy/viwWBpydzfYQsvNFz?blocks=hide"> SPARC Airtable sheet</a> to automatically get award numbers and contributors information such that you don't have to enter them manually in your metadata file. To enable this, you have to connect your Airtable account with SODA. You will only have to do that one time, SODA will then automatically connect to your Airtable account during subsequent uses.

We suggest keeping your group information up to date in the Airtable sheet, especially contributors' names, email, affiliations, and ORCID to help SODA help you!

## How to

1. Create an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/).

2. Get access to the <a href="https://airtable.com/tblFGEvUoTbbG6tJy/viwWBpydzfYQsvNFz?blocks=hide">SPARC Airtable sheet </a> (contact Dr. Charles Horn at <a href="mailto:chorn@pitt.edu" style='color: white'> chorn@pitt.edu</a>).
             
3. Under the "Create submission.xlsx" feature from the "Prepare Metadata" section, click on "Yes" when prompted to connect your Airtable account.

4. Provide a key name of your choice and enter your Airtable API key in the dedicated SODA interface. Checkout the <a href="https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219046777-How-do-I-get-my-API-key" style="color:white;"> Airtable Help page</a> to learn how to obtain or re-generate your API key. Note that the key will be stored locally on your computer and the SODA Team will not have access to it.

5. Click on "Connect".

6. Click on the edit button next to "User award(s)" to add/edit your SPARC award(s) that will then be remembered by SODA to help you prepare your SPARC metadata files easily.
