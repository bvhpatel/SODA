## Background

The Curation Team reviews each SPARC dataset to ensure it adheres with the SPARC Dataset structure and requirements. If not, a back-and-forth will ensue between dataset owner/manager and the Curation Team to address the issues. To make the dataset review process more seamless, we have implemented a validator in SODA that automatically checks for your dataset for high-level errors and errors commonly seen by the Curation Team. Note that SODA's validator (more user friendly, adapted for the pre-review stage) is different from the validator developed and used by the Curation Team and some errors may still be identified by the Curation Team after submission.

## How to

**To validate a SODA-structured dataset**:
- Once you have specified files and metadata files from the previous steps, click "Validate" to have your dataset validated by SODA's validator before the dataset is actually generated.

**To validate a local dataset**:
- Select a local dataset that you would like SODA to validate, and then click on "Validate" to have your dataset validated by SODA's validator.

## Notes

You can save the validator report as a PDF file by clicking on "Generate report" so you can conveniently access it while working on the issues without having to keep SODA running on your computer.
