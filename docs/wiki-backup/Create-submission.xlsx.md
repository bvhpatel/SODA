## Background

Under this feature, SODA lets you rapidly prepare the submission metadata file for your dataset. This feature is designed to avoid commonly found errors when preparing this file. The expected structure of this file, generated automatically by SODA, is explained in our corresponding ["How to" page](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/How-to-structure-the-submission-metadata-file) if you would like to learn about it.

SODA makes use of two resources to help you prepare the submission file rapidly and without errors:
1. The SPARC Airtable sheet as explained [here](Connect-your-Airtable-account-with-SODA).
2. The Data Deliverables document associated with your award. This document list the milestones and associated datasets as agreed between awardees and SPARC. In the submission metadata file, it is necessary to provide milestone and milestone completion dates associated with your dataset exactly as specified in the Data Deliverables document. This document is usually kept by the PI of the SPARC award or the award manager. Click [here](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/How-to-get-your-data-deliverables-document) to find out more about it.

## How to

1. We suggest to add/edit your Airtable account and SPARC award(s) as instructed [here](Connect-your-Airtable-account-with-SODA) then confirm. 
2. Select an award number from the drop-down list (if Airtable account added) or type award number manually then confirm.
3. We suggest importing your Data Deliverable document. SODA will automatically extract milestones and associated information which will be used to help you prepare the submission metadata file. You will have to do this only once and it will be then remembered by SODA during subsequent uses. Note that the information from your Data Deliverables document will be saved locally on your computer so only visible to you.
4. Choose a milestone from the list compiled from the Data Deliverables document or type it manually. Choose/type "Not specified in the Data Deliverables document" if this dataset isn't associated with any milestone initially planned. 
5. Choose/type the date associated with this milestone
6. Review and click on "Generate" to generate your submission file. The generated file will be ready to be included in your dataset.
