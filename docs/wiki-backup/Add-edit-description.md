## Background

All SPARC datasets must have the following metadata on Blackfynn: subtitle, description, banner image, and license. This interface allows you to easily add a description to your dataset. This description will be highly visible on the SPARC data portal once your dataset is published.

## How to 

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and dataset. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. In the textbox, provide a detailed description of your dataset. It is typically recommended to include three sections: Study Purpose, Data Collected, and Primary Conclusion. You can see published datasets on [sparc.science](https://sparc.science/) for inspiration.
3. Click on "Add description".
