## Background

With this feature, you can generate your dataset based on information specified during the previous steps ([Specify dataset files](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Specify-dataset-files) and [Specify metadata files](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Specify-metadata-files)). The dataset could be generated locally on your computer or directly on Blackfynn (to avoid duplicating files locally, save local storage space, etc.)

## How to 

You can generate your dataset through one of the two options explained below.

### Create new dataset on computer
If this option is selected, your dataset will be generated locally at the desired location on your computer. No modifications will be made to the original files/folders specified in the tables.<br><br>
1. Click on "Select destination" to navigate to the desired location of the new dataset. Only a folder can be selected. <br>
2. Enter the name of the new dataset (a folder with this name will be created at the selected destination) <br>
3. Click "Generate" to create your dataset.

### Create new dataset directly on Blackfynn
If this option is selected, files and folders specified in the table will be uploaded following the SPARC Dataset Structure to the corresponding Blackfynn dataset along with the requested metadata files. No modifications will be made to the original files/folders.<br><br>
1. Select desired Blackfynn account from the drop-down list.<br>
2. Select a Blackfynn dataset from the drop-down list.<br>
3. Click on "Generate" to start uploading the files and folders on to your Blackfynn dataset.
