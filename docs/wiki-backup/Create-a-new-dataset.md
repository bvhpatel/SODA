## Background

You can create a new dataset on Blackfynn through this feature of SODA. The name of the dataset will be displayed as the title of the dataset when the dataset becomes public. It is thus advised to make sure that your dataset title is different than your other dataset titles and that it is relatively informative.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. Enter the desired name for the dataset.
3. Click "Create dataset".
