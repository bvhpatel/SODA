## Background 

One year after the dataset completion date (as per the Data Deliverables document) or right after publishing results from the dataset, whichever comes first, you must publish your dataset to Blackfynn Discover, which populates the SPARC Data Portal, and make it public.
               
As per the SPARC publishing process, when ready for publishing, you must submit your dataset for review again to the Curation Team who will make a final check of your dataset and accept or reject the publication request. If accepted, the dataset will be published automatically on Blackfynn Discover. Otherwise, the Curation Team will inform you of the reasons for rejecting.

## How to 

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and dataset. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. Click on "Submit". The dataset could also be withdrawn from review by clicking on "Withdraw from review".
