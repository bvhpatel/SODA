## Background

Under this feature, SODA lets you rapidly prepare the submission metadata file for your dataset using information provided under the "Provide award information" feature. This feature is designed to avoid commonly found errors when preparing this file. The expected structure of this file, generated automatically by SODA, is explained in our corresponding ["How to" page](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/How-to-structure-the-submission-metadata-file) if you would like to learn about it.

## How to

1. Select an award number from the drop-down list
2. Choose a milestone from the list compiled from  the Data Deliverables document imported to SODA in the feature "Provide award information". Choose "Not specified in the Data Deliverables document" if this dataset isn't associated with any milestone initially planned. 
3. Select the description corresponding to your dataset and SODA will automatically populate the associated completion date. Choose "Not specified in the Data Deliverables document" if this dataset isn't associated with any description initially planned.  
3. After you complete all steps, click on "Generate" to generate your submission file. The generated file will be ready to be included in your dataset.
