In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at [bPatel@calmi2.org](mailto:bPatel@calmi2.org).

Last revised date: 04/08/2021

## 1. Why do we collect information?

Tracking is implemented as part of our agreement with the SPARC program to report usage statistics for SODA. Tracking is also used to spot errors and subsequently improve user experience

## 2. What information do we collect?

We automatically collect certain information when you launch, use, or navigate SODA (the App). This information is collected **anonymously** and does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, operating system, information about how you use our App, and other technical information. 

For a detailed list regarding what information is tracked within the App please refer to [What do we track?](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Privacy-Policy#what-do-we-track).

We employ the use of Google Analytics to track and log user events within the App. To learn more, please visit their [Terms of service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/).

## 3. How do we use the collected information?

This information is to generate usage analytics (number of users, features being used, etc.) for our reporting purposes.

## 4. Will the collected information be shared with anyone?

Collected information will be shared with the SPARC management team. It may also be shared with other SPARC-funded groups as well as displayed on our publicly accessible GitHub page.

## 5. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

We use Google's Universal Analytics program to track anonymized user interactions within the App. To learn more about the technologies used please refer to [Security and privacy in Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2838718?hl=en).

## 6. How long do we keep the collected information?

We will only keep collected usage data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## 7. How do we keep the collected data safe?

Collected information is completely anonymized. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cyber-criminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your information, the transmission of personal information to and from our App is always a possible risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.

## 8. What are your privacy rights?

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.

If you are a resident of Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.

## 9. Controls for do-not-track features

Most operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
