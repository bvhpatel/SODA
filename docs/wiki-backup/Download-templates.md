## Background
The Curation Team has release templates for all the metadata files required in SPARC datasets. These templates are available in SPARC Dataset Structure which may be [downloaded as a zip file](https://github.com/SciCrunch/sparc-curation/releases/tag/dataset-template-1.2.3). They are used in SODA when generating the metadata files. You can also download them conveniently in this SODA feature in case you wish to fill them out manually. 

## How to

Simply click on the name of the file and select the destination folder to download.
