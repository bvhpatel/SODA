This step serves as a confirmation page before SODA generates your dataset. You can preview your dataset organization with specified SPARC metadata files and specified dataset generate options. This is how your dataset will look once it is generated either on Blackfynn or locally on your computer. To edit any details from this step, simply click on the Edit icon next to a section. This will bring you back to the associated section for edits.

When you are ready to generate your dataset, click the Generate button.
