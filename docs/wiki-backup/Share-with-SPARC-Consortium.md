## Background 

Once your dataset is approved by the Curation Team, it is ready to be shared with the SPARC Consortium as embargoed dataset. Sharing will give "viewer" permissions to any SPARC investigator who has signed the SPARC Non-disclosure form and will allow them to see your data. They will then be able to view and download your dataset from Blackfynn.

## How to 

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and dataset. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. Click on ’Share now’ to share your dataset with the SPARC Consortium.
