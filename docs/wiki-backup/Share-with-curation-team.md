## Background 

Sharing your dataset with the Curation Team must be done only when your dataset is ready to be reviewed. Sharing with the SPARC Curation Team will give them "manager" permissions, which is necessary for them to review your dataset, and set the dataset status to "03. Ready for Curation" (see our [documentation on dataset status](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/View-and-change-dataset-status) thus adding the dataset to the Curation Team's queue for review. It is then highly recommended to not make any changes to your dataset. 

## How to 

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and dataset. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. Click on ’Share now’ to add your dataset to the Curation team's review queue.
