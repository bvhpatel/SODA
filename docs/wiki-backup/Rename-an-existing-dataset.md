## Background

You can rename an existing dataset on Blackfynn through this feature of SODA. The name of the dataset will be displayed as the title of the dataset when the dataset becomes public. It is thus advised to make sure that your dataset title is different than your other dataset titles and that it is relatively informative.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Blackfynn account and the dataset that you wish to rename. If you have not connected your Blackfynn account with SODA yet, see [here](Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA).
2. Enter a new name and click "Rename".
