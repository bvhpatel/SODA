## Checklist: prepare and submit SPARC datasets with SODA

This is the suggested workflow for preparing and submitting your SPARC datasets with SODA using the Free Form Mode features. All these steps are mandatory (unless marked otherwise) if you wish to satisfy the SPARC requirements. 

### Preliminary steps (only required once)
- [ ] 1. Read about the [SPARC requirements for organizing and sharing all SPARC datasets](https://sparc.science/help/7k8nEPuw3FjOq2HuS8OVsd).
- [ ] 2. Sign up to [Blackfynn](https://app.blackfynn.io/) and get access to the SPARC Consortium organization (contact [joost@blackfynn.com](joost@blackfynn.com) for help)
- [ ] 3. Download and install the [Blackfynn agent](https://developer.blackfynn.io/agent/index.html) required to upload files through SODA
- [ ] 4. Open SODA and watch our quick video located under the Overview tab to familiarize yourself with the user interface of SODA.


### A. Prepare Dataset on Blackfynn (under the Manage Datasets tab of the Free Form Mode)
- [ ] A1. [Connect your Blackfynn account with SODA](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Connect-your-Blackfynn-account-with-SODA). This is only required the first time you use SODA.
- [ ] A2. [Create a new dataset](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Create-a-new-dataset) 
- [ ] A3. [Make PI of the SPARC award the owner of the dataset](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Make-pi-owner-of-dataset)
- [ ] A4. [Give access to other members/teams who may need to contribute to the dataset](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/add-edit-permissions) (note: optional)
- [ ] A5. [Add a subtitle](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/add-edit-subtitle)
- [ ] A6. [Add a description](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/add-edit-description)
- [ ] A7. [Upload a banner image](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Upload-a-banner-image)
- [ ] A8.  [Assign a license](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Assign-a-license)

### B. Prepare SPARC Metadata Files (under the Prepare Metadata tab of the Free Form Mode)
- [ ] B1. Prepare protocol on protocols.io following the [instructions provided here](https://sparc.science/help/1slXZSS2XtTYQsdY6mEJi5)
- [ ] B2. [Prepare submission file](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/create-submission.xlsx)
- [ ] B3. [Prepare dataset description file](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/create-dataset_description.xlsx)
- [ ] B4. Prepare subjects file ([download template](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Download-templates) in SODA, more support will be available in SODA soon - note: required only if your study includes subjects)
- [ ] B5. Prepare samples file ([download template](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Download-templates), more support will be available in SODA soon - note: required only if your study includes samples)

### C. Organize dataset according to the SPARC Dataset Structure (under the Prepare Datasets tab of the Free Form Mode)
- [ ] [Specify files and metadata files to be included in your dataset and generate dataset directly on Blackfynn](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Organize-dataset) 

### D. Submit Dataset to the Curation Team for Review (under the Disseminate Datasets tab of the Free Form Mode)
- [ ] [Share with the Curation Team to add your dataset to their queue for review](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Share-with-curation-team) (it is highly suggested to not make any changes after this step until you are contacted by the Curation Team)

### E. Post-curation steps to be completed ONLY after dataset is approved by the Curation Team (under the Disseminate Datasets tab of the Free Form Mode)
- [ ] E1. [Share dataset with the SPARC Consortium as Embargoed dataset](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Share-with-SPARC-Consortium)
- [ ] E2. [Send dataset for pre-publishing review](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Submit-for-pre-publishing-review)
