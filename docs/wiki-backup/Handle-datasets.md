## Background

You can create a new dataset or rename an existing dataset on Blackfynn through this feature of SODA. The name of the dataset will be displayed as the title of the dataset when the dataset becomes public. It is thus advised to make sure that your dataset title is different than your other dataset titles and that it is relatively informative.

## How to

### To create a new, empty dataset on Blackfynn:

1. Enter the desired name for the dataset.
